# PHAS0102-High-Performance-Computing
High performance computing techniques implemented using python with OpenCL in two assignments and a larger project done in two stages.

## Assignment 1:
Simple particle simulator with N(=100) particles all producing a potential. Simulation done using standard python loops, numba and OpenCL and running times for these three are compared.

## Assignment 2:
Create a simple 'Grid' class to import and export vtk files and implement a finite difference method for the wave equation running in parallel (OpenCL).

## Project:
Stage 1 solves the Poisson equation using a standard centered finite difference scheme and stage 2 considers a parabolic equation with the same domain space as stage 1. Full code explanation and results in supporting pdf documents.
